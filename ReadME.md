## Introduction

### Background
Elections are a cornerstone of democracy, and understanding the factors that influence voter behavior is crucial for political parties, policymakers, and analysts. In modern campaigns, advertising plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing voters. However, the relationship between ad spending and election outcomes is complex, influenced by regional dynamics, historical voting patterns, and grassroots efforts.

This project explores the 2024 Ghanaian election results and advertising spending data** to analyze the impact of ad spend on voter turnout and election performance. By examining the correlation between ad spend and votes received, identifying regional patterns, and evaluating spending efficiency, we aim to uncover insights into how political campaigns can optimize their strategies for future elections.



### Objectives
1. Analyze the Relationship: Investigate the correlation between ad spend and election results for the two major parties: NDC (National Democratic Congress) and NPP (New Patriotic Party).
2. Identify Regional Trends: Examine regional voting patterns and ad spend distribution to understand strongholds and swing regions.
3. Evaluate Spending Efficiency: Assess how effectively each party converted ad spend into votes.
4. Visualize Data: Create visualizations, including maps, to represent regional ad spend and election results.



### Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on three key datasets:
1. Election Results: Contains the number of votes received by NDC and NPP in each region.
2. Ad Spending: Tracks the amount spent on advertising by each party in specific regions.
3. Advertisers: Provides details about the total ad spend and number of ads run by each party.



### Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Merge and clean datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform statistical analysis and generate visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
- Correlation Analysis: Measure the relationship between ad spend and votes received.
  



### Key Questions
1. Does higher ad spending correlate with higher votes in a region?
2. Which regions are strongholds for NDC and NPP, and how does ad spend align with these patterns?
3. How efficient is each party‚Äôs ad spend in converting to votes?
4. Are there regions where low ad spend still resulted in high voter loyalty?





## Insights & Conclusion

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ad Spend vs Election Performance
 Strong Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation between ad spend and votes received for both parties:
NDC: Correlation of 0.87
NPP: Correlation of 0.78
Key Insight: Higher ad spending is associated with higher votes, though other factors (e.g., party loyalty, regional issues) also play a significant role.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regional Patterns in Votes & Ad Spend
 High-Turnout Regions: Greater Accra and Ashanti had the highest voter turnout and received the most ad spend from both parties.
  Winning Regions:
  NDC won in 12 out of 16 regions.
NPP won in 4 regions : Ashanti, Eastern, North East, and Ahafo.
Loyalty vs Ad Spend : Some regions, like Volta and Upper West, had low ad spend but high voter loyalty to NDC, indicating strong traditional support.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ad Spend Efficiency
NDC Dominance**: NDC spent significantly more overall ($52,086) compared to NPP ($9,902) and secured more votes.
Ashanti Exception**: NPP won Ashanti despite lower ad spend, showcasing strong traditional party support in the region.
Greater Accra Impact**: Greater Accra, which had the highest ad spend, was won by NDC, reinforcing the effectiveness of targeted ad campaigns.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Discrepancies in Spending vs Voting Outcomes
High Spend, Low Returns: Some high-spending regions (e.g., Ashanti for NDC) did not translate directly into votes.
Low Spend, High Loyalty: In some cases, low spending didn‚Äôt stop regions from voting overwhelmingly for a party (e.g., Volta for NDC).
Key Insight: Historical political allegiance, grassroots campaigns, and local issues significantly influence election outcomes beyond ad spend.



## Conclusion
Ad Spend Matters, But Isn‚Äôt Everything**: While ad spending positively influences election results, it is not the sole determinant of success. Factors like party strongholds, grassroots mobilization, and regional issues also play critical roles.
Efficiency Over Expenditure: More money spent doesn‚Äôt always guarantee victory. Efficient allocation of resources and understanding regional dynamics are key to maximizing impact.
Future Analysis**: To gain deeper insights, future analyses could incorporate:
Social media engagement metrics.
Sentiment analysis of voter behavior.
Comparative studies of ad spend effectiveness across different media platforms.
